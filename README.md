## **Documentation**

### **Overview**

The Expense Tracker is a simple yet effective tool designed to help users manage their expenses and budgets. It provides functionalities for recording expenses, tracking spending by category, managing budgets, and visualizing spending patterns. This application is developed using object-oriented programming principles in C++.

**Problem Statement**

In today's fast-paced life, managing personal finances efficiently is crucial. However, keeping track of expenses and maintaining a budget can be challenging for many individuals. To address this issue, we have developed a Personal Expense Tracker. The Expense Tracker will allow users to record their expenses, manage their budgets, and visualize their spending patterns.

**Features**

1. **Expense Tracking**
- Users can record their expenses by providing details such as expense name, amount, date, and category.
- Expenses are categorized into different categories including food, shopping, bills & utilities, fun, and miscellaneous.
2. **Budget Management**
- Users can add money to their budget, which is then used to cover their expenses.
- The application keeps track of the remaining budget after deducting expenses.
3. **Expense Visualization**
- Users can visualize their spending patterns using matplotlib in Python.
- The application provides a simple interface to plot expenses over time.
4. **Expense and Budget Graph**
- Users can see the graphs of budget and expense that user made and keep track of their expenditure with date.
- The application provides interactive and colorful pie chart of expenses category-wise.

**Why did we use Class?**

In the provided code for the Expense Tracker application, a class named Finance is used to encapsulate all the functionalities related to expense tracking, budget management, and visualization. Here are some reasons why a class is used in this context:

1. **Encapsulation:** The Finance class encapsulates related data (such as expense details, budget information) and functionalities (such as adding expenses, managing budget) into a single unit. This promotes modularity and allows for better organization of code.
1. **Abstraction:** The class provides an abstraction layer that hides the internal implementation details from the user. Users of the class (in this case, the main function or other parts of the program) interact with it through a well-defined interface (i.e., public member functions) without needing to know the internal workings.
1. **Code Reusability:** By encapsulating related functionalities within a class, the code becomes more reusable. The same class can be instantiated multiple times in different

   parts of the program or in different projects, without duplicating the code for expense tracking and budget management.

Overall, using a class in the Expense Tracker application helps in achieving better organization, modularity, and maintainability of the codebase, while also adhering to the principles of object-oriented programming.

**Usage**

1. **Initialization:**
- Upon starting the application, users are prompted to choose whether to reset data or continue with previous data.
- The application creates or resets expense and budget files accordingly.
2. **Main Menu:**
- Users are presented with a main menu containing the following options:
1. Show Budget
1. Show Expenses
1. Add Money
1. Add Expenses
1. Plot Expenses
1. Exit
3. **Functionality:**
- Users can select an option from the menu to perform various tasks such as viewing budget details, adding money to the budget, recording expenses, and visualizing spending patterns.
4. **Input Validation:**
- The application validates user inputs to ensure correctness and consistency.
- Error messages are displayed for invalid inputs, and users are prompted to enter correct values.

**Contributions**

This Expense Tracker project was a collaborative effort of four team members, each contributing to different aspects of the project:

1. **User Interface and Input Handling:**

Contributor: **VIBHOR KUMAR**

- Implemented the user interface including menu options and input handling.
- Ensured user inputs are validated and errors are handled gracefully.
2. **File Management and Data Persistence:**

Contributor: **KSHITIJ DHAMANIKAR**

- Implemented file management functionalities for creating, reading, and writing expense and budget data.
- Ensured data persistence across multiple sessions of the application.
3. **Expense Tracking and Budget Management:**

Contributor: **KUSHAGRA AGARWAL**

- Developed the core functionalities for tracking expenses, managing budgets, and categorizing expenses.
- Implemented algorithms for calculating remaining budget and updating expense records.
- Helped in finding various graphical and logical error.
4. **Visualization and Integration with Python:**

Contributor: **ANURAG THAKUR**

- Integrated matplotlib library in Python for visualizing spending patterns.
- Developed scripts for plotting expenses and generating visualizations based on expense data.
- Error handling was also done by him.

**Conclusion**

The Expense Tracker project demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming principles in developing a practical tool for managing expenses and budgets. Through collaborative efforts, the team successfully implemented various functionalities and ensured a user-friendly experience.
